This repository contains all the code for my website. 

## Documentation

I used a template that can be found at its [github repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/hugo-website/). The template uses the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) with some modifications. If you would like to download it for yourself, the gitpage has instructions on how to set it up. 
The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/) and the template is documented at https://pascalmichaillat.org/b/.

## Illustration

The website produced by the template can be viewed at https://pascalmichaillat.org/hugo-website/.
