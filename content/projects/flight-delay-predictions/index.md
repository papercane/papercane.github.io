description: "This paper studies the correlation between flight dates, lengths, etc with its flight delays." 
summary: "Its purpose is to help determine ways in which we can shorten the delays and maximize efficiency. As the last project in the watspeed course: XXX, we chose a project that interests us to reflect what we learnt."

##### Abstract

This project identifies patterns and causes of flight delays. The analysis could help develop mitigation strategies and improve service reliability. 
Components of the project include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python, Pandas and data visualizations. Our analysis primarily focuses on airlines with the longest delay times, examining both arrival and departure delays across origin and destination cities. Additionally, we explore patterns of delays by city, as well as temporal trends by day of the week and month.
